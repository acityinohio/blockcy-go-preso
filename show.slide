* The Best Way to Learn an API? Build a Wrapper!

* As a diehard Gopher, I used Go.

* Some Easy Queries

* Similarity by Smart Design

- You focus on your application, BlockCypher focuses on scaling the crypto.
- That said, BlockCypher aligns itself with the core tenants of cryptocurrency.
- If you ever want to run your implementation, you can.
- In many cases, a drop-in replacement for your own daemon.

BlockCypher has an incredibly simple payment forwarding service.
But it's deceptively powerful.

In addition to loving Go, I also love Go (Igo/Baduk).

* Whither BlockCypher?
One word: cryptowagers. 2-of-3 multisig would be perfect.

An Ã¼ber-minimal MVP:

- Players enter board size, public keys for multisig address and "move" signing, final address for funds if they win, and send initial funds.
- Why not use ECDSA signing for the moves, too? No accounts, no problem!
- Players move pieces by "signing" their move, server checks to make sure they're not moving twice in a row (and associates board state with multisig).
- Once both players pass, score is checked. Server readies transaction to winning player's address, asks that player to sign; broadcasts to network.
- If both players quit/don't want to use the server anymore, they can sign their own multisig transaction with or without BlockCypher's API.

* Demo Time!

* Maybe a Silly Example, but...
- With better UX, could actually be a nice experience.
- And consider what it could represent.
- Creating webapps/apps that work in trust-limited or database-limited environments.
- The possibilities are endless.
- ...and importantly for me, when I finally beat Steve at Go, I'll get bitcoin for my trouble.
