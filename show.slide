* Just Released Our Go Wrapper

* Similarity by Smart Design

- You focus on your application, BlockCypher focuses on scaling the crypto.
- That said, BlockCypher aligns itself with the core tenants of cryptocurrency.
- If you ever want to run your implementation, you can.
- In many cases, a drop-in replacement for your own daemon.

BlockCypher has an incredibly simple payment forwarding service.
But it's deceptively powerful.

* New APIs Released Rapidly

- HD Wallets: derive and watch addresses from xpubs.
- Metadata: private/public key-value associated with blockchain objects.
- Open Assets: coming soon.

* An Anecdote

In addition to loving Go, I also love Go (Igo/Baduk).

* Whither BlockCypher?
- One word: cryptowagers. 2-of-2 multisig would be perfect.
- An Ã¼ber-minimal MVP:
- 2-of-2 multisig, record moves with null-data embeds within blockchain...no datastore.
- No accounts, no problem. Users can use webapp to validate moves/get TX data to sign themselves locally.
- Web app can validate score at game end, help players assemble transactions.

* Demo Time!

* Maybe a Silly Example, but...
- With better UX, could actually be a nice experience.
- Creating webapps/apps that work in trust-limited or database-limited environments.
- ...and importantly for me, when I finally beat Steve at Go, I'll get bitcoin for my trouble.
