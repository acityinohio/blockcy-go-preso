# Blockcy-Preso-2015-03

This is a presentation about building cool things with [BlockCypher](http://blockcypher.com/) and Golang. I presented it to [Boost VC](http://boost.vc/) on March 14th, 2015.

To view this presentation online, try [this link](http://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/acityinohio/blockcy-preso-2015-03/show.slide). Please note that the code examples will throw errors because the Go Playground (which Go-Talks uses) doesn't support non-standard library imports. If Go-Talks is offline/you want to run the presentation with the code examples---and if you have Golang installed---you can always download the "present" tool and run it locally. Here's the command to get "present"

	go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present

Then, assuming your GOBIN is in your path directory, just run "present" within this directory locally.

	present

Navigate your web browser to the address listed by "present" the tool. For more info about the present tool, or other configuration options, check the [GoDoc here.](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present)

## Presentation Notes

My notes are included in the `notes.txt` file---you can follow using the slide headings. To check out the demo mentioned, consider installing my [Bitduck webapp.](https://github.com/acityinohio/bitduck) I might run a dedicated server one day, but it's currently in a pretty alpha state. Feedback on everything here always welcome!
